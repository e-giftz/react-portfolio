## Description
This is a website that is more than just a description of skills, but a place that demonstrates what I am capable of as a full stack Web developer. A way to proof the skills and talents mentioned in my resume and other professional profiles such as LinkedIn.
This was initially created with HTML/CSS and later updated  with  Bootstrap,hpwever, for this project, I implemented the use of REACT to get a more simplified front-end.

## Why was this project built
Apart from being a requirement coursework for the Full Stack Web Developmenty program, this portfolio was developed as the avenue to showcase the technical and practical deliverables of a web developer. 
For the final lap of this project, the REACT skills gained was put to practice and exhibited. A look at the website shows the incorporation of REACT.js consepts like the use of hooks and pages as well as JSX and other aesthetics. In addition the creative side of a web developer is also represented in the use of colors, and the entire look of the web page.
