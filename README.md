Creating my portfolio using react
A portfolio of work that showcases my skills and talents as a fullstack Web developer in a more practical and visual way to employers using  REACT.JS 

## Description
This is a website that is more than just a description of skills, but a place that demonstrates what I am capable of as a full stack Web developer. A way to proof the skills and talents mentioned in my resume and other professional profiles such as LinkedIn.

## Why was this project built
Apart from being a requirement coursework for the Full Stack Web Developmenty program, this portfolio was developed as the avenue to showcase the technical and practical deliverables of a web developer. 
For the first lap of this project, the HTML/CSS skills was put to practice and exhibited. A look at the website shows the incorporation of HTML/CSS consepts like responsive webpages, navigation menus, the various make  up of the body of the web page, use of flexbox and other aesthetics. In addition the creative side of a web developer is also represented in the use of colors, and the entire look of the web page.

> Updated: This portfolio  has been updated with the recent just-completed project showcasing JavaScript skils as well as jQuery skills. More updates and edits were made to the existing HTML/CSS code for better user experience. These updates include: 
>* Repositioning the profile picture image so tehre is no overlap when viewed on smaller screen
>* Swapping the "About-me" and "Portfolio" navigation links so that the about-me link comes first.
>* Updating the screnshots on this README.md file so that it is functional and depicts the current look of the website.
